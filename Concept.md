A Feast For Odin - Journey Through Valhalla
A digital solo adventure of the classic boardgame

Some Ideas:
- Drafting the Action Board
- Upgrading/Drafting the Town Square
- Going through multiple Acts
- Gaining enough points to favour the gods in each Act
- An upgrade phase in between each act 

### Act 1: Virtuous and Benevolent
- Baldr: The god of light, purity, and beauty. His benevolence makes him a natural starting point for a virtuous tier.
- Sif: Associated with fertility, family, and agriculture, Sif represents abundance and stability.
### Act 2: Neutral and Pragmatic
- Freyja: A goddess of love, fertility, and war, Freyja bridges light and shadow with her dual nature.
- Njord: A sea god who represents wealth, prosperity, and peace but has a mercantile pragmatism.
### Act 3: Chaotic and Twisted
- Loki: The trickster god embodies mischief, chaos, and cunning, presenting morally complex challenges.
- Hel: The ruler of the underworld, she represents death and the unknown, offering a foreboding climax to the journey.
